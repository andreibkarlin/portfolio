# My Scratch Projects

## "Plants vs Zombies Awesome Version"
I made this game when I was only nine years old, showing how my passion for programming and computer science started at a young age. Besides the sound and the art in the original game, I made everything myself.
In order to place a plant you must hit space over a seed packet (at the top) and then click where you want to place it on the lawn. The game is playable here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/67810884/.

## Meapr (Programming Language)
This is by far the most complicated thing I made on Scratch: an entire programming language created when I was in middle school. It has a tutorial and everything, but unfortunately due to the limitations of Scratch, 
the game is laggy. Additionally, an update Scratch made, which removed hacked blocks, caused some of the project to break, such as the ability to delete characters in the editor. If you want to see all of the code you can 
press "See Inside" and click on the cat to see some of the code involved in the project. The link to the project is here (there is a tutorial inside the project): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/210598818/.

## Sans Fight (Beta)
This is a decently complicated game which I made in middle school. While unfinished, I had to create an entire engine for simulating all of the features in the original game (Undertale),
such as the poison damage, the gaster blasters, the orange and blue attacks, and more. The game is playable here (instructions are next to the game): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/306674404/.

## Competition, A Game of Squares
This game was originally based on [Yee diagrams](http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/) to measure voting systems. Each player (up to four people can play at the same time) and NPC (which can be set to easy or hard difficulty) 
will want to control a plurality of the map in order to get points, and at the end of the game the one with the most points wins. It's a simple, well designed, well polished game, playable here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/309189212/.
